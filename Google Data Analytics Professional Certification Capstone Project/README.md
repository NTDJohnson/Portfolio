The folder on this repository houses my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification - the contents are best viewed with a larger screen such as desktop setup.

The data used for the project has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) and can be accessed through [this link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)  - At the time of this project, the most recent 12 month’s data was used (April 2022 to March 2023). 

Microsoft SQL Server was used for data cleaning and manipulation - the data cleaning steps taken are found in ‘Data_Cleaning.sql’. 


The key takeaways, data insights and visualisations may be found in ‘Powerpoint_Report.pptx’ and outline the main output of the project - you will need to select it and download the raw file to view it. Tableau was used for data visualisation and Microsoft Excel was used for the statistical hypothesis testing.


Thankyou for your time - I hope you enjoy.
Best wishes,
Nathan Johnson
